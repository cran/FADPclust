Description: An implementation of a clustering algorithm for functional data based on adaptive density peak detection technique, in which the density is estimated by functional k-nearest neighbor density estimation based on a proposed semi-metric between functions. The proposed functional data clustering algorithm is computationally fast since it does not need iterative process.
